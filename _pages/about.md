I am a M.Sc. student at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/) at [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/). Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant under the supervision of professor [Jin Guo](http://jguo-web.com/) in [Knowledge Enhanced Software Connectivity (KESEC)](http://jguo-web.com/lab.html) lab. Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from [School of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science](http://science.ut.ac.ir/en/math) at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). More information is in my [CV](/assets/files/cv.pdf).

My research interests are in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval and Software Engineering.
