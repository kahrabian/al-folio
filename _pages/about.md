I'm a M.Sc. student at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/). Currently, I am working as a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Jin Guo](http://jguo-web.com/) in [Knowledge and Software Technology (KAST)](http://jguo-web.com/lab.html) lab. Before joining McGill, I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) advised by [Prof. Bagher BabaAli](https://rtis2.ut.ac.ir/cv/babaali/?lang=en-gb). Also, I used to work at [Cafe Bazaar](https://cafebazaar.ir/?l=en) as a Tech Lead. You can find my detailed CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Natural Language Processing, with a current emphasis on the Knowledge Graphs.
